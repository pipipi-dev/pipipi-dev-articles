## 🛠️ Setup Guide

### 1. Create Apidog Account

1. Create account at [Apidog](https://apidog.com/)
2. Create new project

### 2. Obtain Access Token

```
Account Settings → API Access Token → "+ New" button
Name: Claude-Code-Integration (arbitrary)
Expiration: Never expire (or specify date)
```

### 3. Claude Code Configuration

> **Note**: MCP Server Naming Conventions
> 
> Claude Code recommends lowercase, hyphen-separated MCP server names.
> 
> ❌ Names with spaces:
> ```json
> "API specification": { ... }
> ```
> 
> ✅ Lowercase, hyphen-separated names:
> ```json
> "apidog": { ... }
> ```
> 
> Inappropriate names may cause connection errors.

**Configuration File Example**

```json
// Add to ~/.claude.json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "apidog": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "apidog-mcp-server@latest",
        "--project-id=YOUR_PROJECT_ID"
      ],
      "env": {
        "APIDOG_ACCESS_TOKEN": "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 4. Verification

```bash
# After restarting Claude Code, verify functionality
# Connection verification within Claude Code
# (Actual API access methods depend on MCP server implementation)
```

If successful, your created API list should be displayed.

*Note: If no APIs are created, please create a simple API first (e.g., GET /api/todos) before verification.*

### (Optional) Local File Testing

For testing with local OpenAPI specification files:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "apidog": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "apidog-mcp-server@latest",
        "--oas=/path/to/openapi.json"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## 🔄 Development Workflow

### Human Role: Specification Creation in Apidog

**1. Browser-based Specification Creation**
- Create API specifications by simply filling out forms
- Configure parameters and responses through interface
- Real-time preview confirmation

**2. Browser-based Testing**
- Execute tests directly on created specifications
- Verify functionality with mock servers
- Automatically create response examples

**3. Team Collaboration**
- Real-time change synchronization
- Multiple version management
- Configurable team permissions

### AI Role: Implementation in Claude Code

**1. Automatic Latest Specification Retrieval**

Claude Code automatically retrieves the latest API specifications via MCP server and generates code based on them.

**2. Specification-based Code Generation**

```typescript
// Auto-generated from Apidog specification
interface CreateUserRequest {
  email: string;
  password: string;
  profile: {
    firstName: string;
    lastName: string;
    preferences?: UserPreferences;
  };
}

// Implementation also generated according to specification
async function createUser(
  request: CreateUserRequest
): Promise<CreateUserResponse> {
  // Validation, DB operations, response formatting
  // All generated based on specification
}
```

**3. Specification-based Implementation Support**

AI assists in implementation while referencing API specifications to ensure compliance.

## 📈 Expected Benefits

### Before and After Comparison

**Before: Traditional Development**

```
Spec Planning → Implementation → Manual Testing → Documentation
     ↓              ↓              ↓               ↓
   Uncertain    Error-prone      Tedious      Forgotten
```

- Half day to full day for one feature addition
- Specification changes requiring rework
- Frequently forgetting documentation updates

**After: Using Apidog MCP**

```
Apidog Design → MCP Implementation → Auto Testing → Auto Sync
      ↓                ↓                 ↓           ↓
    30 min           15 min            5 min      Instant
```

- One feature addition reduced to about 1 hour
- Significant reduction in implementation errors through type safety
- Documentation update work becomes unnecessary

### Achievable Benefits

**🎯 Improved Development Experience**
- Reduced time worrying "which specification is correct?"
- Quick access to previously written specifications
- Maintain consistency through specification-referenced implementation

**⚡ Enhanced Work Efficiency**
- End-to-end execution from API design to implementation
- Eliminate manual type definition writing
- Test code also auto-generated from specifications

**🔒 Quality Stability**
- Significant reduction in bugs from human error
- Consistent implementation based on specifications
- Enhanced validation through type safety

## 💡 Implementation Points and Future Outlook

### Recommended Gradual Introduction
Starting with small APIs and developing specification-first habits is important. Rather than starting with the entire team immediately, it works better to get familiar individually before expanding.

### Security Considerations
Be careful not to commit configuration files (~/.claude.json) containing access tokens to Git.

### Future Expectations
We expect further efficiency improvements in API development workflows as the MCP ecosystem expands, enabling connections with more tools and services.
